# Resources in Sinatra

To get an understanding of how resources and routes work in Rails, I implemented a resource `members` in [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). 

This is based on [this exercise](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/exercises/sinatra_resource.html) from the Berlin study group [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/).
